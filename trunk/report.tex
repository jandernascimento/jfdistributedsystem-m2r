\section{Introduction}
This paper will give a short review of a system called Walter which is a key-value store that supports transactions and replicates data across distant sites and the key features which are behind it, such as Parallel Snapshot Isolation (PSI), preferred sites and counting sets. PSI provides a strong guarantee within a site; across sites, PSI provides casual ordering and precludes write-write conflicts.

The need of such a system is because web applications are increasingly deployed over many data centers or sites around the world to provide better locality, availability and distance tolerance which involves geo-replication. The benefit of transaction is to group writes in an atomic unit so that failures do not leave behind partial writes and concurrent access by other services are not intermingled(isolation). Without them there is a significant burden which have to be dealt by developers of end applications. The key features of Walter are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Asynchronous replication across sites.} Replication is done lazily in the background to reduce latency
\item \textit{Efficient update-anywhere for certain objects.} Counting sets can be updated efficiently anywhere, while other objects can be updated efficiently at their preferred site
\item \textit{Freedom from conflict-resolution logic}. which is complex to developers
\item \textit{Strong isolation within each site.} Provided by PSI.
\end{itemize}
          
\section{Parallel Snapshot Isolation}
Snapshot isolation ensures that (a) transactions read from a snapshot that reflects a single commit ordering of transactions, and (b) if two concurrent transactions have a write-write conflict, one must be aborted.
 
\textit{Parallel snapshot isolation} extends snapshot isolation by allowing different sites to have different commit orderings. PSI's relaxation is acceptable for web applications where each user communicates with one site at a time and there is no need for a global ordering of all actions across all users. 

To avoid write-write conflicts across sites and for implementation of PSI, Walter uses two techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Preferred sites.} Each object is assigned a preferred site which is the site where writes to the object can be committed without checking other sites for write conflicts.
\item \textit{Conflict-free counting set objects.} A cset is similar to a multiset in that it keeps a count for each element, but unlike multisets, the count could be negative. A cset support an operation $add(x)$ to add element $x$, which increments the counter of $x$ in the cset; and an operation $rem(x)$ to remove $x$, which decrements the counter of $x$. Because increment and decrement commute, $add$ and $rem$ also commute, and so operations never conflict. 
\end{itemize}

PSI property specification:

PSI \textsc{property} 1. \textit{(Site Snapshot Read) All operations read the most recent committed version at the transaction's site as of the time when the transaction began.}

PSI \textsc{property} 2. \textit{(No Write-Write Conflicts) The write sets of each pair of committed somewhere-concurrent transactions must be disjoint.}

PSI \textsc{property} 3. \textit{(Commit Causality Across Sites) If a transaction $T_{1}$ commits at a site A before a transaction $T_{2}$ starts at site A, then $T_{1}$ cannot commit after $T_{2}$ at any site.}

%may be add some other info
It is said that the transactions are \textit{somewhere-concurrent} if they are concurrent at $site(T_{1})$ or at $site(T_{2})$.

The anomalies which might appear because of the isolation properties of PSI are \textbf{short fork} and \textbf{long fork}. The others, such as dirty read, non-repeatable read, lost update or conflicting fork are not allowed.

\section{Design and Algorithm}

Each site has a local Walter server and several clients. Communication is done with Remote Procedure Calls. A \textit{Configuration Service} is responsible for leasing the role of preferred site to a container as well as currently active sites. 

For keeping track the sequence of operations, Walter uses vector timestamps to synchronize between sites. Each site has a local version number indicating the number of transactions reflected in the snapshot.

There exist two types of transactions: the fast and slow commit. The fast commit is used for objects who are local to the preferred site and involves two checks: first, checking if the objects are unmodified since the transaction started and second if all the objects are unlocked. The slow commit is used for transactions whose object's preferred site is not local and it is done in two phases: first, the server asks the objects preferred sites if they are unmodified and unlocked and if all of them are "yes" then it proceeds to commit as a fast commit protocol.

Propagation of committed transactions is done asynchronously to the other sites. When all the transactions are committed at all sites it is marked as globally visible. 

\section{Evaluation}

They first evaluated the base performance of Walter comparing it with Berkely DB 11gR2. The resulted transaction throughputs of read and write were comparable.

The benchmark consisted in either write or read transactions each accessing one 100 byte object. Experiments were run on Amazon's EC2 cloud platform in four sites across the globe. 

The micro-benchmark for evaluating the throughput of transactions across several sites with read/write operations as well as performing several operations within one transactions showed a linear scalability with the number of sites. Read throughput is bounded by the RPC performance and write throughput is lower compared to the read one because of the lock contention. Having several operations within one transactions increases the throughput compared with every operation being a single transaction. 

As far as the latency concerns, when having fast commits this was mainly influenced by the effects of queuing inside the Walter server and of flushing the commit log to disk resulting a 99.9 percentile latency of 27 ms. When it comes to disaster safe transactions the latency is approximately uniform distributed between $[RTT_{MAX},2*RTT_{MAX}]$ where $RTT_{MAX}$ is the maximum round trip latency between the site which issued the transactions and other sites.

\section{Conclusion}

The authors have designed a transactional geo-replicated key-value store with the key feature of Parallel Snapshot Isolation which in case of asynchronous replication, avoids conflicts across sites allowing efficient implementation of application, demonstrated by WaltSocial and ReTwis which achieved reasonable performance.
