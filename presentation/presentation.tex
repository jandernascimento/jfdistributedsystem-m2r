		\begin{frame}{State of the art}
		
			%talk about sinfonia compare with other the type server that dont use transactions
		\begin{itemize}
		\item Walter: key-value store database, supporting transactions and replication of data across remote sites
		\item There exists several systems (Sinfonia, Percolator) which offer support for transactions but they target applications on a single site. 
		\item Whereas the systems which target distributed application don't offer support for conflict-resolution logic
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{frame}{Properties}
		
		%put properties that must to be obey	
		\begin{itemize}
		
		\item (Site Snapshot Read) All operations read the most recent committed version at the transaction's site as of the time when the transaction began
		\item (No Write-Write Conflicts) The write sets of each pair of committed somewhere-concurrent transactions must be disjoint
		\item (Commit Causality Across Sites) If a transaction $T_{1}$ commits at a site A before a transaction $T_{2}$ starts at site A, then $T_{1}$ cannot commit after $T_{2}$ at any site
		
		\end{itemize}

		% to be added Fig. 8 (table and short fork, long fork pictures and a little bit of text).

		\begin{frame}{PSI and Conflict resolution}
		
		For avoiding write-write conflicts, two techniques are used:
		
		\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Preferred sites: Each object is assigned a preferred site where writes to it can be committed without checking other sites for conflicts
		\item Conflict-free counting set objects: csets only allow incrementation or decremental of elements, operation which are commutative  
		
		\end{itemize}
		
		\end{frame}
		
		\begin{frame}{Types of transaction}
		
		\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Fast commit: used for objects which are local to the preferred site, involving two checks (objects are unmodified since the transaction started and unlocked)
		
		\item Slow commit: the preferred site of the object if a non-local one. This involves 2-phases: all the objects are unmodified and unlocked on their site, and after this it goes as a fast commit protocol		
		
		\end{itemize}

		\end{frame}
 	
	\subsection{Site Synchronization}
	 	
 	%talk about 	 	
	 	
		\begin{frame}{Introduction}
				
		\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Synchronizing among the sites Walter uses vector timestamps
		\item Each site has a local version number indicating the number of transactions in the snapshot
		\item This allows a casual ordering of the events
		
		\end{itemize}

\section{Performance}

	\subsection{Features}
	
	\begin{frame}{Features}
	
		\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Asynchronous replication across sites.} Replication is done lazily in the background to reduce latency
		\item \textit{Efficient update-anywhere for certain objects.} Counting sets can be updated efficiently anywhere, while other objects can be updated efficiently at their preferred site
		\item \textit{Freedom from conflict-resolution logic}. which is complex to developers
		\item \textit{Strong isolation within each site.} Provided by PSI.
		\end{itemize}
